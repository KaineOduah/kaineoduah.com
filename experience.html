      <h3>Pennsylvania State University — Media Assistant</h3>
      <p><strong>What I Did:</strong> Supported courses and events with reliable A/V. I handled day‑of operations for lecture capture, projection, and sound; kept equipment healthy; and built small, no‑friction tools so instructors could focus on teaching instead of setup.</p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Operated cameras, capture systems, and projectors; reduced setup time and cut mid‑class interruptions.</li>
        <li>Created quick utilities and checklists and standardized slide templates; made recurring tasks consistent for faculty and student workers.</li>
        <li>Documented procedures so handoffs were clear and recoveries under time pressure were predictable.</li>
      </ul>
