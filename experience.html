<div class="entry"> <div class="when">2023–2025</div> <div class="content"> <h3>Pennsylvania State University, Media Assistant</h3>
<p>What I Did: Paired day‑to‑day A/V support with small quality‑of‑life tools. I wrote simple scripts to confirm capture devices were ready and storage was available, set up a lightweight page with checklists and timers for operators, and kept the gear healthy so classes could start on time.</p>
<ul class="bullets"> <li>Quick pre‑class checks reduced setup surprises and interruptions.</li> <li>Post‑event tasks like renaming and exporting recordings were streamlined to save a few minutes each session.</li> <li>Clear procedures and templates made handoffs easy for faculty and student workers.</li>
</ul> </div> </div>
<div class="entry"> <div class="when">2022</div> <div class="content"> <h3>Matrix Group Logistics Inc, IT Support</h3>
<p>What I Did: Made routine website updates clearer and safer. I organized pages into reusable pieces, added small checks that caught broken links early, and used a simple review process so edits were easy to publish and even easier to roll back if needed.</p>
<ul class="bullets"> <li>A small library of shared page sections (headers, promos, repeated blocks) cut down on one‑off edits.</li> <li>Early link and HTML checks prevented most regressions before changes went live.</li> <li>Lightweight backups and a “last published” note kept history clear.</li>
</ul> </div> </div>
<div class="entry"> <div class="when">Community</div> <div class="content"> <h3>African Student Association & NSBE</h3> <p>What I Did: Helped plan events and mentorship activities that connected students and shared practical skills. These roles sharpened my communication under pressure and my habit of turning loosely defined ideas into plans with owners and dates.</p> </div> </div>
