        <h3>Pennsylvania State University, Media Assistant</h3>
        <p>I served as the connective tissue between content experts and the technology they used to present it. On any given week that meant designing small web interfaces for interactive sessions, preparing media assets for large displays, and debugging the edge cases nobody sees until showtime.</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Designed lightweight HTML/CSS/JS interfaces that transformed static presentations into clear, interactive moments tailored to each event’s goals.</li>
          <li>Standardized asset workflows and wrote small scripts that removed repetitive steps, helping teams hit deadlines without last‑minute chaos.</li>
          <li>Created concise documentation and checklists so teammates could reproduce results quickly and recover from common issues without escalation.</li>
          <li>Collaborated with speakers and organizers to simplify narratives, reduce cognitive load, and keep attention on the material rather than the mechanics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The consistent theme was craftsmanship: fewer moving parts, sharper visuals, and a bias for solutions that keep working after hand‑off.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h3>Group Logistics Inc, IT Support</h3>
        <p>I maintained the company website and improved the clarity of key pages. Along the way I wrote small batch tools to speed up common edits and coached teammates on simpler processes that made updates less fragile.</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Streamlined content updates by introducing consistent page sections and sensible defaults, cutting down the time from request to publish.</li>
          <li>Improved navigation labels and layout so visitors could find the right information without guesswork.</li>
          <li>Established a basic versioning routine so accidental changes were easy to spot and roll back.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result was a site that felt calmer to maintain and easier to extend as needs evolved.</p>

        <h3>ASA and NSBE</h3>
        <p>Helped organize events and mentorship activities. These experiences sharpened my communication under pressure and my ability to turn loosely defined ideas into plans with owners and timelines.</p>
